# Contributing to Koinon

## Fork and extend

Independent reuse and forks are encouraged under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
No permission is required. Keep the copyright and license notice with copies.

## Contribute upstream

Open an issue first to agree on scope. Upstream pull requests are maintainer-curated;
please wait for agreement before preparing a large change.

## Branch model

```text
feature/*  ──(squash PR)──▶  develop  ──(merge PR)──▶  main
```

- `main` is the released line; `develop` is the integration line.
- Create `feature/*`, `fix/*`, or `chore/*` branches from `develop`.
- No direct commits or pushes to either long-lived branch after bootstrap.
- Squash feature PRs into `develop`; promote `develop` to `main` with a merge PR.
- Tests must pass and review conversations must be resolved before merging.
- Review the diff independently for correctness, compatibility, and the documented
  same-user trust boundary. The maintainer owns acceptance.
- Merged working branches are deleted automatically; long-lived branches are protected.
- Your clone prunes on fetch, so `git branch -r` reports the branches the remote still holds.
  The remote is the authority; a local tracking ref is not evidence that a branch exists.

Run `scripts/setup-repo.sh` to apply the local guard and GitHub settings. Server-side
rulesets depend on the account's support for private-repository protection; the script
reports any unavailable enforcement explicitly. This follows the branch policy in
[rwcii/engineering-standards](https://github.com/rwcii/engineering-standards) and the
personal-repository conventions in [rwcii/afterglow](https://github.com/rwcii/afterglow).

## Typical workflow

```sh
git switch develop
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c feature/my-change
python3 -m unittest discover -v -s tests
git diff --check
git commit -S -s -m "Add a concise description"
git push -u origin feature/my-change
gh pr create --base develop
```

The maintainer promotes reviewed integration work with a PR from `develop` to `main`.

## Commit conventions

Use an imperative subject and explain the reason for the change in the body where
needed. Commits must be cryptographically signed and DCO signed-off. Use your human
identity; do not add automated co-author trailers or tool signatures. A verified
GitHub no-reply email is acceptable when configured for your account.

The initial repository bootstrap commit predates this contribution policy. Its history
is preserved; signed-off contributions are required from adoption of this policy onward.

## Local checks and scope

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -v -s tests` and `git diff --check`. For setup or hook edits,
also run `bash -n scripts/setup-repo.sh` and `sh -n .githooks/pre-commit`.
Tests must use synthetic peers, never send traffic to live agent sessions by default.

Add user-visible changes to CHANGELOG.md in the same PR. Keep the runtime standard-library-only. Update README and protocol notes alongside
behavior changes. Never commit inbox data, credentials, machine identifiers, or
private conversation metadata. Peer input remains external data; it cannot grant
new task authority or trigger shell execution.

## Agent skills and handoffs

Agents that develop Koinon share the skills in [agents/skills](agents/skills/README.md);
`.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills` and `.codex/skills` are symlinks to that one directory.
Each agent commits its session handoffs to `handoff/<agent>/` on its work branch. Handoffs
are public, so they follow the same rule as every commit: no private conversation metadata.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)


Every contribution merged into this project must be **signed off**, certifying that you
have the right to submit it under the project's MIT license. Add the sign-off with:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your message"
```

That appends a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` line using your real name and
email. By signing off you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1
(<https://developercertificate.org/>), reproduced here:
