"""Shared per-repository memory service. Python standard library only.

One service per repository, shared by every agent session working in it. It holds
an append-only event log and serves it over a private control socket, so a session
that started earlier can still learn what a later session decided.

The service stores reported data. Nothing here grants authority: an entry cannot
approve an action, widen a task scope, or change any configuration. See
`docs/PARITY-MEMORY-DESIGN.md` for the contract this implements.

Three rules shape the storage design, and each exists because its absence produced
a defect in review:

* **Liveness is recorded, never derived.** A supersession or revocation writes a
  durable link onto the row it replaces. Deriving liveness from rows that still
  exist lets reclamation of a replacement resurrect what it replaced.
* **A snapshot is frozen, not referenced.** Members are copied as immutable
  payloads at creation, so a concurrent revocation cannot change what a reader is
  still paging through, and reclamation cannot make a page unreachable.
* **The server owns protocol state.** Page issuance, completion and acknowledgement
  are recorded here, never inferred from a number the caller supplies.
