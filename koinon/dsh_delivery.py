"""DeepSeek harness adapter: notice delivery and session facts.

Notice delivery is the bridge's `codex queue` analogue; `default_model` supplies
the model id a DeepSeek peer advertises in its peer name.

The DeepSeek harness has no `queue` subcommand, so a notice reaches a session
through its local HTTP RPC instead: `session/prompt` with `mode: "queue"`
resolves to the agent's `followup`, which is the same "wake this session with a
message" primitive that `codex queue` provides. `mode: "steer"` would resolve to
`steer` instead; notices deliberately use `queue` so an in-flight turn is never
interrupted by peer traffic.

The RPC listens on loopback and is gated by an authority-bound HMAC cookie. Its
signing secret is a per-user, mode-0600 file in the harness home, so an ordinary
same-user process can mint the cookie. That is what keeps this adapter inside a
standard-library-only runtime and avoids requiring an in-process plugin.

Wire contract, as implemented by the installed harness:

    POST <base>/api/session/prompt
    {"type":"client-request","rpcId":"...","method":"session/prompt",
     "payload":{"args":{"request":{
        "requestId":"...","sessionId":"...","mode":"queue",
        "content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}],"clientTimeZone":"UTC"}}}}

    cookie name   "dsh-auth-" + base64url(sha256(authority))
    cookie value  "v1." + base64url(json payload) + "."
                  + base64url(HMAC-SHA256(secret, <the base64url body string>))

The signature covers the **encoded body string**, not the raw JSON, and the
signed `authority` must equal the `Host` header. Both details are load-bearing:
getting either wrong yields a plain 401 with no other diagnostic.

Scope note: the destination is constrained to loopback. The cookie is an
authentication credential for the local harness, and this module refuses to send
it anywhere else.
