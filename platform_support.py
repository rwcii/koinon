"""Platform-specific process, credential, and socket primitives.

The bridge speaks one wire protocol on every platform, but the local facts it
relies on differ between Linux and macOS. This module is the only place that
knows those differences, so `bridge.py`, `notify.py`, and `session.py` stay
platform-neutral.

Three differences matter:

* **Peer identity.** Linux exposes `SO_PEERCRED`, one getsockopt returning the
  peer pid, uid, and gid. macOS has no such option: `getpeereid(3)` returns only
  uid and gid, and the peer pid comes from a separate `LOCAL_PEERPID` socket
  option. Both halves are required, so macOS needs two calls where Linux needs
  one.
* **Process start time.** Linux reads field 22 of `/proc/<pid>/stat`, a count of
  clock ticks since boot. macOS has no `/proc`; `ps -o lstart=` reports the
  start time as an asctime string. Claude Code writes `procStart` in UTC
  asctime form on macOS and as the tick count on Linux, so the value we publish
  and the value we compare against must match the local convention exactly.
* **Process namespace.** Linux peers identify themselves as
  `linux:<machine-id>:<pid-namespace>`. macOS Claude Code uses the literal
  string `darwin`.

Python standard library only.

    path is one byte shorter. An over-long `bind` fails with an opaque
    "AF_UNIX path too long" and the bridge simply never starts.

    The state directory can legitimately be deeper than that. A per-session
    state directory adds `sessions/<16 hex>`, and macOS puts temporary
    directories under a long `/var/folders/...` path, which is enough to exceed
    the limit. When the natural path does not fit, the socket is placed in the
    peer socket directory instead, under a name derived from the state
    directory, so it stays unique per instance and just as private: that
    directory is already required to be mode 0700 and owned by this user.

    The digest uses the **resolved** directory, so one state directory reached
    through two spellings (a symlinked parent, a relative path) still maps to one
    socket. A server and a later CLI invocation must agree on this path.

    The fallback lives in the shared socket directory rather than in the instance
    state directory, so cleanup does not own it. A path left behind by a killed
    instance is therefore removed by hand after verifying the old process is dead
    and its socket refuses connections, exactly as the project already requires for
    stale peer sockets. Nothing here removes a socket automatically: a listening
    socket and a saturated one are indistinguishable by probing, because a full
    accept queue refuses a connection on macOS just as a dead owner does.
